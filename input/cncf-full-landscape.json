Some of the notable use cases include:\nTiansuan Constellation Program: KubeEdge has been integrated into the cloud-native satellite computing platform initiated by the Shenzhen Institute of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) with Spacety Co., Ltd. KubeEdge brings in orbit-earth collaboration for the Tiansuan-1 Satellite in the platform, this integration has enabled new service scenarios such as image inference, incremental deep learning, and federated learning.\nChina's highway electronic toll collection (ETC) system: KubeEdge has been instrumental in managing nearly 100,000 edge nodes and over 500,000 edge applications in 29 of China's 34 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions. With these applications, the system processes more than 300 million data records daily and supports continuous updates of ETC services on highways. As a result, the time taken to pass through toll stations has been reduced from 29s to 3s for trucks, and from 15s to 2s for cars.\nHong Kong-Zhuhai-Macao bridge: KubeEdge manages edge nodes deployed on the world's longest sea crossing bridge, which collects up to 14 different types of sensor data, including light intensity, carbon dioxide, atmospheric pressure, noise, temperature, humidity, PM 2.5, PM 10, rain and snow, acceleration, angular velocity, Euler angle, magnetic field, and sound. It also enables business apps and device mapper and AI interference programs to be deployed at the edge.\nSAIC MAXUS MIFA 9: The next-generation car-cloud collaborative architecture, SAIC MAXUS full-size luxury, smart, pure electric MPV MIFA 9, has become the first-ever vehicle with KubeEdge Inside. This platform can manage 100,000+ nodes and millions of edge devices and is based on KubeEdge's capabilities such as lightweight architecture, optimized for unstable cloud-edge networks at scale, simplified heterogeneous IoT device management, and edge autonomy in the case of disconnection.\nCDN platform of China Telecom: KubeEdge is used to manage CDN edge nodes, automatically deploy and upgrade CDN edge services, and implement edge service disaster recovery (DR) when migrating CDN services to the cloud.\nChina Mobile On-line Marketing Service Center: The largest call center in the world, with 44,000 agents, 900 million users, and 53 customer service centers, builds a cloud-edge synergy architecture consisting of two centers and multiple edges based on KubeEdge.\nXinghai IoT: This IoT company provides comprehensive smart building solutions by leveraging a construction IoT platform, intelligent hardware, and AI. Xinghai IoT built a smart campus with cloud-edge-device synergy based on KubeEdge and its own Xinghai IoT cloud platform, greatly improving the efficiency of campus management. With AI assistance, nearly 30% of the repetitive work is automated.\nSF Express: The largest integrated logistics service provider in China and the fourth largest in the world, completely transformed their supply chains by implementing KubeEdge. The smart supply chain system enables edge-cloud synergy, edge data collection, real-time edge data processing, massive IoT device management, and creates a more stable, secure, and reliable edge industrial IoT system.\n",

As a result, organizations witness a change in how applications and services are being architected, built, and deployed. New technologies such as cloud and containers help organizations release faster, at scale. Services need to be built at high velocity and deployed on a vast plethora of platforms. As development accelerates, these systems are becoming increasingly interdependent and interconnected to deliver a consistent customer experience.\n\nOrganizations may be inhibited in achieving high velocity and gaining market share or mission assurance for such major reasons as compliance, the pool of expertise, and interoperability challenges between teams/organizations and within existing solutions.\n\nFor business leaders focused on improving business expediency and returns, SPIFFE can significantly reduce costs associated with the overhead of managing and issuing cryptographic identity documents (e.g. X.509 certificates), and accelerate development and deployment by removing the need for developers to understand the identity and authentication technologies required to secure service-to-service communication.\n\nTechnology integration as a result of organizational convergence can be a challenge when different technology stacks must come together and interoperate. Aligning on a common, industry-accepted standard for system-to-system communication with identity and authentication, simplifies the technical aspects of full interoperability and integration across multiple stacks.\n\nSPIFFE brings a shared understanding of what constitutes software identity. By further leveraging SPIFFE Federation, components in disparate systems in different organizations or teams can establish trust to communicate securely without the added overhead of constructs such as VPN tunnels, one-o certificates, or shared credentials for use between such systems.\n",

At its core, SPIFFE is:\n\nA standard defining how services identify themselves to each other. These are called SPIFFE IDs and are implemented as Uniform Resource Identifiers (URIs).\n\nA standard for encoding SPIFFE IDs in a cryptographically-verifiable document called a SPIFFE Verifiable Identity Document or SVIDs.\n\nAn API specification for issuing and/or retrieving SVIDs. This is the Workload API.\n\nThe SPIFFE Project has a reference implementation, the SPIRE (the SPIFFE Runtime Environment), that in addition to the above, it:\n\n- Performs node and workload attestation.\n\n- Implements a signing framework for securely issuing and renewing SVIDs.\n\n- Provides an API for registering nodes and workloads, along with their designated SPIFFE IDs.\n\n- Provides and manages the rotation of keys and certs for mutual authentication and encryption between workloads.\n\n- Simplifies access from identified services to secret stores, databases, services meshes and cloud provider services.\n\n- Interoperability and federation to SPIFFE compatible systems across heterogeneous environments and administrative trust boundaries\n\nThe SPIFFE Workload API can attest running software systems and issue SPIFFE IDs and SVIDs to them. This in turn allows two workloads to establish trust between each other, for example by establishing an mTLS connection or by signing and verifying a JWT token. Use of SPIFFE can also enable workloads to securely authenticate to a secret store, a database, or a cloud provider service.\n",

As a result many non-cloud-hosted Kubernetes clusters don’t support persistent storage. External storage arrays are non-portable and can be extremely expensive.\nLonghorn delivers simplified, easy to deploy and upgrade, 100% open source, cloud-native persistent block storage without the cost overhead of open core or proprietary alternatives.\n* Easy incremental snapshots and backups\nLonghorn’s built-in incremental snapshot and backup features keep the volume data safe in or out of the Kubernetes cluster.\nScheduled backups of persistent storage volumes in Kubernetes clusters is simplified with Longhorn’s intuitive, free management UI.\n* Cross-cluster disaster recovery\nExternal replication solutions will recover from a disk failure by re-replicating the entire data store. This can take days, during which time the cluster performs poorly and has a higher risk of failure.\nUsing Longhorn, you can control the granularity to the maximum, easily create a disaster recovery volume in another Kubernetes cluster, and failover to it in the event of an emergency.\nIf your main cluster fails, you can bring up the app in the DR cluster quickly with a defined RPO and RTO.",
