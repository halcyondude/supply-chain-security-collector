### **Revised Goal:**
Perform a full data collection for all CNCF projects. Then, using the project's own schema definition (`schema.json`), create a dynamic TypeScript script to orchestrate DuckDB. This script will ingest the raw, nested JSONL, transform it into a flat, analytics-ready structure with proper data types (like timestamps), and automatically create full-text search indexes on relevant text fields. The final output will be a single, highly optimized Parquet file, ready for immediate exploration in DuckDB and Jupyter.

### **Revised Actionable Steps:**

1.  **Update and Persist Plan:** I will update `REGENERATION_PLAN.md` with this new, more detailed plan.
2.  **Update Input Data:** Refresh the CNCF project lists using the existing `fetch:cncf` script.
3.  **Full Data Collection:** Run the data collection for all three CNCF tiers (sandbox, incubation, graduated) for both default and extended queries (6 total runs).
4.  **Create Dynamic Ingestion Script (`scripts/ingest-raw-data.ts`):** This is the core of the new plan. I will write a TypeScript script that:
    *   Reads the target schema from `docs/schema.json`.
    *   Uses `glob` to find all `raw-responses.jsonl` files to be processed.
    *   Programmatically connects to an in-memory DuckDB instance.
    *   Executes a series of queries to ingest and progressively flatten the nested JSON data using `UNNEST`.
    *   Dynamically generates a final `SELECT` statement that casts fields to their correct types (e.g., `string` to `TIMESTAMP`) based on the schema.
    *   Creates a final, transformed table from this data.
    *   Intelligently identifies text-heavy columns from the schema and automatically creates full-text search (FTS) indexes on them.
    *   Exports the final, indexed table to a single, compressed Parquet file: `output/cncf-all-analyzed.parquet`.
5.  **Create Analysis Notebook:** Generate a new `analysis.ipynb` notebook that demonstrates how to load and query this new Parquet file.
6.  **Provide Access Instructions:** Deliver the final command to launch the DuckDB UI for exploration.
