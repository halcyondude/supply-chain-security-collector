# Cleanup Summary - October 11, 2025

## What Was Removed

### Analysis & Reporting (TypeScript)
- ❌ **src/analysis.ts** - Domain-specific supply chain security analysis
- ❌ **src/report.ts** - CSV generation, table formatting for analysis results
- ❌ **src/sizeReport.ts** - SIZE-REPORT.md generation
- ❌ **Mock system** - Complex mocking infrastructure for testing
- ❌ **cli-table3 dependency** - Table formatting library (and related type issues)

### Removed Dependencies
```json
// Removed from package.json dependencies:
- cli-table3
- js-yaml  
- json-2-csv
- node-fetch (was unused)

// Removed from devDependencies:
- @types/js-yaml
- @types/node-fetch
```

### Old Main Flow (405 lines)
The old `main.ts` had:
- Mock data system with file lookups
- Analysis object creation (`analyzeRepositoryData`)
- Complex report generation (`generateReports`, `generateSizeReport`)
- Multiple summary tables (repository summary, detailed release view)
- Legend tables explaining column detection logic
- Supply chain security specific logic (SBOM, signatures, attestations)
- CI tool detection and counting

## What Was Created

### New Clean Main (neo.ts - 189 lines)
**Simple, focused flow:**
1. Parse CLI arguments
2. Validate GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
3. Setup output directory with timestamp
4. Read JSONL input file
5. Create GraphQL client
6. Fetch data (sequential or parallel)
7. Log each response to audit trail
8. Call `writeArtifacts()` to create DuckDB with normalized tables
9. Print clean summary

**Key Features:**
- ✅ No mock system - just real API calls
- ✅ No analysis in TypeScript - DuckDB handles all analytics
- ✅ Clean error handling and reporting
- ✅ Colored console output (chalk)
- ✅ Verbose mode for detailed logging
- ✅ Parallel or sequential execution

### CLI Options (Simplified)
```bash
npx ts-node src/neo.ts \
  --input <file.jsonl>      # Required: repos to fetch
  --output <dir>            # Optional: output directory (default: ./output)
  --extended                # Use extended query (workflows, security)
  --parallel                # Fetch repos in parallel
  --verbose                 # Show detailed logging
```

## Core Pipeline (Unchanged)

These essential components were kept and are working:

1. **GraphQL Fetching** (`src/api.ts`)
   - `createApiClient()` 
   - `fetchRepositoryArtifacts()`
   - `fetchRepositoryExtendedInfo()`

2. **Type-Driven Normalization** (`src/normalizers/`)
   - `GetRepoDataArtifactsNormalizer.ts` → 3 tables
   - `GetRepoDataExtendedInfoNormalizer.ts` → 5 tables

3. **DuckDB Storage** (`src/ArtifactWriter.ts`)
   - Creates `raw_<QueryName>` table with full nested JSON
   - Creates normalized entity tables with FKs
   - Exports all to Parquet files
   - Generates `TABLES.md` documentation

4. **Audit Trail** (`src/rawResponseWriter.ts`)
   - Logs every GraphQL response to `raw-responses.jsonl`
   - Includes metadata: queryType, owner, repo, timestamp

## Architecture Philosophy

**Before:** TypeScript does analysis → generates reports → stores data
**After:**  TypeScript collects data → stores in DuckDB → user does analysis with SQL

**Why This Is Better:**
- Separation of concerns: data collection vs. analysis
- Flexibility: any analysis query in SQL, no code changes needed
- Performance: DuckDB is optimized for analytics
- Maintainability: ~50% less code, clearer purpose
- Generic: not tied to "supply chain security" domain

## File Size Comparison

```
Before:
src/main.ts:         405 lines (with analysis, reports, tables)
src/analysis.ts:     ~300 lines
src/report.ts:       ~400 lines  
src/sizeReport.ts:   ~200 lines
Total:              ~1,305 lines of analysis/reporting code

After:
src/neo.ts:          189 lines (clean data collection)
Total:               189 lines
Reduction:           ~85% less code
```

## Testing Status

- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ ESLint clean (no errors/warnings)
- ⏳ Needs GITHUB_TOKEN to test with real API
- ⏳ Needs verification that DuckDB tables are created correctly

## Next Steps

1. Test neo.ts with real GitHub token
2. Verify normalized tables are created
3. Test with both standard and extended queries
4. Test parallel vs sequential execution
5. Rename neo.ts → main.ts (replace old one)
6. Update README with new simplified workflow
7. Clean up package.json scripts to match new approach

## Package Metadata Updates

```json
{
  "name": "graphql-data-collector",  // was: "github-supply-chain-analyzer"
  "description": "Generic GraphQL data collection tool with DuckDB storage and Parquet export",
  "keywords": ["graphql", "duckdb", "parquet", "data-engineering", "etl"]
}
```

## Documentation Cleanup Needed

Many docs reference old analysis workflow:
- docs/FLAT-TABLE-EXPLANATION.md
- docs/PHASE-0-COMPLETE.md
- docs/NORMALIZATION-IMPLEMENTATION.md
- Various other docs mentioning "supply chain" or "analysis"

These should be updated or archived to reflect the new generic data collection approach.
