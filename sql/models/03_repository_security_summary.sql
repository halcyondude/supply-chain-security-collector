-- Repository Security Summary Model
-- ============================================================================
-- Aggregates security signals at the repository level for high-level analysis:
-- - SBOM adoption and formats
-- - Signing and attestation practices
-- - CI/CD tool usage
-- - Security maturity metrics
-- 
-- Depends on: base_repositories, base_releases, agg_artifact_patterns, agg_workflow_tools
-- Creates: agg_repo_summary table
